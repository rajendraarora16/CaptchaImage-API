CaptchaImage
============

CaptchaImage, an API made by Rajendra arora.

I hope so, you're really goona play with my small API. It's very easy to use and to implement with any dynamic content website, you just need to add this into external jar file as well.

In this API simply contains a "CaptchaImage" class. so to implement this captcha into your website you just need to invoke as

"CaptchaImage obj = new CaptchaImage();" //here you've created an object but remeber you need to import as well and simply it can be done using:

import com.RajendraArora.CaptchaImage;

If you're looking for an example that how to use it, it contains an example file along the zip. But don't worry it's very easy to use it, that's why i made this for you.
